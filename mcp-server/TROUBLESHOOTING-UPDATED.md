# MCP Server Troubleshooting Summary (Updated)

## Issues Fixed

1. **JSON Response Format Error**
   - Fixed missing closing bracket in JSON-RPC response format in server.js
   - Properly structured the response according to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification

2. **Method Name Inconsistency**
   - Added a `getContext()` method to CPQContextProvider class that delegates to the existing `getCPQContext()` method
   - This ensures compatibility with both method names

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added better error handling for file loading in CPQContextProvider
   - Added fallback paths for finding rulesList.json

4. **MCP Protocol Compliance**
   - Updated the initialization handshake to properly follow MCP protocol
   - Removed welcome message that might interfere with the protocol handshake

5. **SDK-based Implementation** 
   - Created new server implementation using official MCP SDK
   - Added proper capabilities declaration according to the protocol
   - Improved error handling and diagnostic logging

## Testing Tools Created

1. **Simple Server Implementation**
   - Created a minimal MCP server implementation focusing on correct initialization
   - Verified that it accepts connections and handles the MCP handshake

2. **Test Client**
   - Developed a test client that can verify MCP server functionality
   - Added diagnostic messages and validation of responses

3. **Debug Helper**
   - Created an MCP debug script to identify connection issues
   - Checks for port conflicts, environment variables, and protocol compliance

4. **Batch Script Improvements**
   - Updated the start-with-mcp.bat to allow selection between simple and main server
   - Ensures proper stopping of processes before starting

## Next Steps

1. **Try Different Server Implementations**
   - Simple server: Basic implementation that just handles initialization
   - Full server: Original server with full CPQ context support
   - SDK server: New implementation using the official MCP SDK (recommended)

2. **Try Different VS Code Integration Methods**
   - Environment variable: Set MCP_SERVER_URL to ws://localhost:3000
   - MCP.json: Use the VS Code built-in MCP server configuration in .vscode/mcp.json
   - Start script: Use the batch script that sets up the environment correctly

3. **Troubleshooting Options**
   - Run the debug script to get a detailed diagnosis
   - Try with GitHub Copilot stable release (not pre-release)
   - Check VS Code logs for MCP-related messages
   - Try a different port if 3000 is in use

## Known Issues

1. **GitHub Copilot Version Compatibility**
   - Pre-release versions of GitHub Copilot might have different MCP implementations
   - Consider trying with a stable Copilot release

2. **MCP Protocol Evolution**
   - MCP protocol is evolving and may have different versions
   - The SDK server should be most compatible with recent versions

3. **Environment Setup**
   - MCP_SERVER_URL environment variable must be set correctly
   - VSCode extension may need to be restarted to pick up environment changes

## Conclusion

We've provided multiple server implementations and tools for troubleshooting. The SDK-based server is the most likely to work with current GitHub Copilot versions as it uses the official MCP implementation. If issues persist with all three server options, consider checking for GitHub Copilot updates or changes in the MCP protocol requirements.
