# MCP Server Troubleshooting Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **JSON Response Format Error**
   - Fixed missing closing bracket in JSON-RPC response format in server.js
   - Properly structured the response according to the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification

2. **Method Name Inconsistency**
   - Added a `getContext()` method to CPQContextProvider class that delegates to the existing `getCPQContext()` method
   - This ensures compatibility with both method names

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added better error handling for file loading in CPQContextProvider
   - Added fallback paths for finding rulesList.json

4. **MCP Protocol Compliance**
   - Updated the initialization handshake to properly follow MCP protocol
   - Removed welcome message that might interfere with the protocol handshake

5. **SDK-based Implementation** 
   - Created new server implementation using official MCP SDK
   - Added proper capabilities declaration according to the protocol
   - Improved error handling and diagnostic logging

5. **SDK-based Implementation** 
   - Created new server implementation using official MCP SDK
   - Added proper capabilities declaration according to the protocol
   - Improved error handling and diagnostic logging

## Testing Tools Created

1. **Simple Server Implementation**
   - Created a minimal MCP server implementation focusing on correct initialization
   - Verified that it accepts connections and handles the MCP handshake

2. **Test Client**
   - Developed a test client that can verify MCP server functionality
   - Added diagnostic messages and validation of responses

3. **Debug Helper**
   - Created an MCP debug script to identify connection issues
   - Checks for port conflicts, environment variables, and protocol compliance

4. **Batch Script Improvements**
   - Updated the start-with-mcp.bat to allow selection between simple and main server
   - Ensures proper stopping of processes before starting

## Next Steps

1. **Test with GitHub Copilot**
   - Run the batch script to start VS Code with the MCP environment
   - Check if GitHub Copilot successfully connects to the MCP server
   - Look for any error messages or connection issues in VS Code's logs

2. **Further Troubleshooting**
   - If issues persist, check if there are processes still using port 3000
   - Run the debug script to get a detailed diagnosis
   - Consider downgrading GitHub Copilot to a stable release if using a preview version

3. **Further Improvements**
   - Consider implementing a more complete MCP server using the official TypeScript SDK
   - Add proper error handling for all edge cases
   - Consider implementing direct file system access for CPQ files

## Known Issues

1. **Port Conflicts**
   - The server uses port 3000 which might be used by other applications
   - Kill any existing Node.js processes before starting the server

2. **Environment Variables**
   - GitHub Copilot requires MCP_SERVER_URL environment variable to be set
   - The batch script tries to set it, but it might not persist in all environments

3. **VS Code Extensions**
   - GitHub Copilot preview versions might have different MCP implementations
   - Consider trying with a stable Copilot release

## Conclusion

The MCP server for Streamline Tools should now be properly configured to handle GitHub Copilot connections. The initialization handshake issue has been fixed, and we've provided multiple tools for testing and diagnosing any remaining issues. If problems persist, use the debug script to identify the specific issue and consult the VS Code MCP documentation for further guidance.
